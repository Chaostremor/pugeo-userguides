    "And you should see the following three modules listed:\n",

    "1) intel-mkl/2018.3/3/64\n",

This means that if you change any parameter in the Par_file after compiling SPECFEM3D GLOBE, you should recompile the code. Recompile the code by running `make clean` and `make all` in the root folder."
